I'm somewhat new to developing. In the past I was more of a product/ customer engagement person, so I started this blog to document some of the work I've been doing as a developer, both to solidify the experience for myself and to share with the rest of the community. God knows there's enough documentation out there, hopefully this will be helpful, too.
